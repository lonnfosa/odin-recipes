    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Simple, easy, and delicious falafel - no breaking apart or spattering while frying! Try serving with pita, parsley and hummus or tahini sauce! Falafel is best when it is fresh. However, if you have leftovers, heat in a single layer in the oven to maintain crispiness.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place garbanzo beans, parsley, onion, flour, garlic, cumin, baking powder, coriander, salt, lemon juice, and black pepper in a food processor or blender. Pulse until combined and a chunky, slightly sticky mixture forms.</li>
        <li>Roll mixture into small balls and place on a plate. Flatten into patties that are 2 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Place patties in refrigerator or freezer to help hold together, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2- to 2-inches vegetable oil in large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry patties, working in batches to avoid crowding, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain patties on paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
